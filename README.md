# Improvements I would make given more time
- Actually document the software
- Refactor into multiple files
- Refactor parse* functions to just use a common one
- Test more edge conditions
- Remove empty lists from return data as indicated in the instructions
- Add error checking, currently assumes the happy path
- Refactor to allow unit testing of routes/http serving rather than just parsing
- Add API documentation, likely don't have it hosted out of the root
